# Hero Carousel Fixes - TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update script.js to correct image file extensions (nn.jpg → nn.jpeg, oo.jpg → oo.jpeg)
- [x] Add CSS styles for .hero-dots and .dot classes in index.css to make carousel indicators visible
- [x] Add toast notification styles to index.css for login/registration success messages

## Summary
Fixed two issues with the image carousel on the home page and added notification system:
1. Corrected mismatched image file extensions in JavaScript
2. Added missing CSS styles for carousel dot indicators
3. Added CSS styles for toast notifications to display success messages on login/registration

The carousel should now display properly with visible navigation dots and correct images. Users will now see toast notifications when they successfully log in or register.
