WHY NO QUIZZES SHOWING? - QUICK CHECKLIST
==========================================

□ Step 1: Did you create the database table?
   → Open your database
   → Run the SQL from database_setup.sql
   → CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS quizzes (...)

□ Step 2: Are you logged in?
   → Make sure you're logged into your account
   → Dashboard requires login

□ Step 3: Did you generate a quiz AFTER logging in?
   → Quizzes only save if you're logged in
   → Generate a new quiz while logged in

□ Step 4: Check browser console
   → Press F12
   → Go to Console tab
   → Look for errors or messages
   → Should see: "Dashboard initializing..."
   → Should see: "Found X quizzes"

□ Step 5: Test the database
   → Visit: http://your-site/test_db.php
   → Check the output:
     - logged_in: should be true
     - table_exists: should be true
     - user_quizzes: should be > 0

□ Step 6: Verify quiz was saved
   → After generating a quiz, open console
   → Type: localStorage.getItem('current_quiz_id')
   → Should show a number

MOST COMMON ISSUE:
------------------
You haven't run the database_setup.sql yet!

SOLUTION:
1. Open your database (phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, etc.)
2. Copy the SQL from database_setup.sql
3. Run it
4. Generate a new quiz
5. Check dashboard again

STILL NOT WORKING?
------------------
1. Open dashboard.html
2. Press F12 (Console)
3. Copy ALL the console messages
4. Check what test_db.php shows
5. That will tell us exactly what's wrong!
